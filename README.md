### Distance between USA airports

This app should calculate the distance between two United States airports in nautical miles, using auto-complete for the airport fields. All United States Airports should be searchable by name or 3 digit code. Bonus: plot the flying (not driving) route on Google maps, the map should display the United States, not the entire earth. Note: please choose the API you think best fits your solution, only United States airports should be included.
